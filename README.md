# Primitive-Network-Playground
Some of my first attempts of implementing Neural Networks in a graphically stylish manner. Nice but primitive

## RawLand

Simple organisms fight for survival, looking to catch the food and reproducing, and hoping not to get eaten by predators.
Each creatue is endowed with a primitive brain, a perceptron whose output is the angle towards the food source; with time, they train the weights and biases of their neuronal connections and pass the values of these parameters to the offspring. Mutations and natural selection will determine which species are meant to dominate, or whether the predators overtake the entire population of preys.

Below, a movie of the first generations at play.

Below, a movie of later generations; notice how fewer species are now dominating.
